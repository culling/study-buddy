While I was studying at university I had a few tools that helped me to track my progress and help with studying. 
The first was a spreadsheet with the current courses, assessments, weightings and marks for those assessments. This also made graphs that helped to easily understand my current progress.

When studying I used a mix of pomodoro and interleaved learning for study and revision. The technique let me learn a lot and kept me engaged with the topics, and this lead to great results. Much like HIIT (High intensity interval training), the sessions are relatively short and are aiming for a high engagement.
